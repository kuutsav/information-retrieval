    "# Unsupervised sentence embedding learning - TSDAE\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will look at the work of `Kexin Wang, Nils Reimers, Iryna Gurevych` on their paper [TSDAE: Using Transformer-based Sequential Denoising Auto-Encoder for Unsupervised Sentence Embedding Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.06979.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the summary of the paper by the authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Learning sentence embeddings often requires\n",
    "a large amount of labeled data. However,\n",
    "for most tasks and domains, labeled data is\n",
    "seldom available and creating it is expensive.\n",
    "In this work, we present a new state-of-theart unsupervised method based on pre-trained\n",
    "Transformers and Sequential Denoising AutoEncoder (TSDAE) which outperforms previous approaches by up to 6.4 points. It can achieve up to 93.1% of the performance of indomain supervised approaches. Further, we\n",
    "show that TSDAE is a strong domain adaptation and pre-training method for sentence\n",
    "embeddings, significantly outperforming other approaches like Masked Language Model.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> A crucial shortcoming of previous studies is the narrow evaluation: Most work mainly evaluates on the single task of Semantic Textual Similarity (STS), which does not require any domain knowledge. It is unclear if these proposed methods generalize to other domains and tasks. We fill this gap and evaluate TSDAE and other recent approaches on four different datasets from heterogeneous domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques we have discussed so far - Bi-Encoders, Cross-Encoders, etc. required labeled data. While they show great performace on in-domain data, their performance declines rapidly on out-of-domain data.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can see that BM25(retriever/candidate generator) and Cross-Encoder(Re-Ranker) works the best while many dense retrievers fail to outperform just the BM25 on most on the datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why not use BM25 + Cross-Encoders?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned earlier, Cross-Encoders are expensive as we can't index the corpus beforehand. For each query, we would need to score the query against all the retrieved candidates(which could be in 100s).\n",
    "\n",
    "So we again come back to Bi-Encoders as they are fast at both indexing the corpus and inference(using ANNs).\n",
    "\n",
    "In TSDAE, the authors train encoder based models with pre-training objective similar to `Masked Language Modeling` but with slight variation.\n",
    "In MLM, we mask some tokens and train the encoders to predict the masked tokens, but in TSDAE, we delete some tokens from the input sentences, create a pooled representation of the sentence(MEAN-pooling or CLS-embedding) and pass that to a Denoising Auto-Encoder to recreate the original input text.\n",

    "Note that the models were trained on a combination of SNLI and MultiNLI datasets without labels and evaluated on the STS benchmark with the metric Spearman rank correlation.\n",
    "CLS and Mean-pooling worked the best with similar performance. They recommend choosing CLS-pooling so we will also use that.\n",
