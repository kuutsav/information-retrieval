The documents could also be in different languagues, encodings, etc. These variations present their own unique sets of challenges. For example, it's common to build separate pre-processing text piplines for each languague."

    "\n",
    "Relevance in the context of queries and documents captures the following key ideas:\n",
    " - A query can consist of many words, we break the query down into these individual words using a text processing pipeline which we will cover later.\n",
    " - If a word appears more often in a document, it's more relevant. We can capture this by counting the words in a document .\n",
    " - If a document is longer, words will tend to appear more often. So we need to take the document length into account as well.\n",
    " - It would be pretty slow if we start counting the words in all the documents after a query arrives, hence we need to store the counts in a data structure that supports efficient lookups for a query.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Tokenization essentially involves splitting the query or document into invdividual terms/words.\n",
    "A naive baseline could split each query/document by whitespace and punctuation character.\n",

    "### Stemming\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming involves reducing the terms/words to their \"roots\" before indexing. An advanved form of stemming called Lemmatization invloves reducing the inflectional/variant forms to base form (am, are, is -> be). Lemmatization is computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For grammatical reasons, documents are going to use different forms of a word, such as organize, organizes, and organizing. Additionally, there are families of derivationally related words with similar meanings, such as democracy, democratic, and democratization. In many situations, it seems as if it would be useful for a search for one of these words to return documents that contain another word in the set.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The goal of both stemming and lemmatization is to reduce inflectional forms and sometimes derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form. For instance:\n",
    "> `am, are, is -> be`, `car, cars, car's, cars' -> car`.\n",
    "> The result of this mapping of text will be something like:\n",
    "> `the boy's cars are different colors -> the boy car be differ color`\n",
    ">\n",
    "> However, the two words differ in their flavor. Stemming usually refers to a crude heuristic process that chops off the ends of words in the hope of achieving this goal correctly most of the time, and often includes the removal of derivational affixes. Lemmatization usually refers to doing things properly with the use of a vocabulary and morphological analysis of words, normally aiming to remove inflectional endings only and to return the base or dictionary form of a word, which is known as the lemma . If confronted with the token saw, stemming might return just s, whereas lemmatization would attempt to return either see or saw depending on whether the use of the token was as a verb or a noun. The two may also differ in that stemming most commonly collapses derivationally related words, whereas lemmatization commonly only collapses the different inflectional forms of a lemma. Linguistic processing for stemming or lemmatization is often done by an additional plug-in component to the indexing process, and a number of such components exist, both commercial and open-source.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The most common algorithm for stemming English, and one that has repeatedly been shown to be empirically very effective, is Porter's algorithm (Porter, 1980).\n",

    "### Stop word removal\n",
    "\n",
    "This simply involves removing the most common words that appear across all the documents. Typically, articles and pronouns are generally classified as stop words. Stop words play no significance in the scoring algorithms used for classic IR hence we remove them.\n",

    " - Look up the statistics for each term from the inverted index.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Types of queries\n",
    "\n",

    " - **Exact matching**: Match full words or concatenate multiple query words with \"or\".\n",
    " - **Boolean queries**: \"and\" / \"or\" / \"not\" operators between words.\n",
    " - **Expanded queries**: Ddd synonyms and other similar words into the query.\n",

    "Another drawback of the scoring models we are about the discuss is the fact they don't consider meaning of the terms. Terms/words are essentially just discrete symbols. Similarly documents are stream of meaningless symbols. The word order is not important as well.\n",
