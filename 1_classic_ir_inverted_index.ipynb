For example, it's common to build separate pre-processing text pipelines for each language."

    " - A query can consist of many words, we break the query down into these individual words using a text processing pipeline which we will cover later.\n",
    " - If a word appears more often in a document, it's more relevant. We can capture this by counting the words in a document .\n",
    " - If a document is longer, words will tend to appear more often. So we need to take the document length into account as well.\n",
    " - It would be pretty slow if we start counting the words in all the documents after a query arrives, hence we need to store the counts in a data structure that supports efficient lookups for a query.\n",

    "A naive baseline could split each query/document by whitespace and punctuation character.\n",

    "### Stemming\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming involves reducing the terms/words to their \"roots\" before indexing. An advanced form of stemming called Lemmatization involves reducing the inflectional/variant forms to base form (am, are, is -> be). Lemmatization is computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For grammatical reasons, documents are going to use different forms of a word, such as organize, organizes, and organizing. Additionally, there are families of derivationally related words with similar meanings, such as democracy, democratic, and democratization. In many situations, it seems as if it would be useful for a search for one of these words to return documents that contain another word in the set.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The goal of both stemming and lemmatization is to reduce inflectional forms and sometimes derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form. For instance:\n",
    "> `am, are, is -> be`, `car, cars, car's, cars' -> car`.\n",
    "> The result of this mapping of text will be something like:\n",
    "> `the boy's cars are different colors -> the boy car be differ color`\n",
    ">\n",
    "> However, the two words differ in their flavor. Stemming usually refers to a crude heuristic process that chops off the ends of words in the hope of achieving this goal correctly most of the time, and often includes the removal of derivational affixes. Lemmatization usually refers to doing things properly with the use of a vocabulary and morphological analysis of words, normally aiming to remove inflectional endings only and to return the base or dictionary form of a word, which is known as the lemma . If confronted with the token saw, stemming might return just s, whereas lemmatization would attempt to return either see or saw depending on whether the use of the token was as a verb or a noun. The two may also differ in that stemming most commonly collapses derivationally related words, whereas lemmatization commonly only collapses the different inflectional forms of a lemma. Linguistic processing for stemming or lemmatization is often done by an additional plug-in component to the indexing process, and a number of such components exist, both commercial and open-source.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The most common algorithm for stemming English, and one that has repeatedly been shown to be empirically very effective, is Porter's algorithm (Porter, 1980).\n",

    "\n",
    "This simply involves removing the most common words that appear across all the documents. Typically, articles and pronouns are generally classified as stop words. Stop words play no significance in the scoring algorithms used for classic IR hence we remove them.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Types of queries\n",
    "\n",

    " - **Exact matching**: Match full words or concatenate multiple query words with \"or\".\n",
    " - **Boolean queries**: \"and\" / \"or\" / \"not\" operators between words.\n",
    " - **Expanded queries**: Ddd synonyms and other similar words into the query.\n",

    "Another way to improve the quality of retrieval is to use spell correctors to:\n",
